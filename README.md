## Adam Grieve

I am a first class Genetics graduate with two years’ post University experience in Finance and Analysis (fintech start-up and global investment administration business) looking to develop a career in the fast-paced and dynamic world of technology. 

I have always had a deeply held appreciation for all things with hidden layers of complexity and am not satisfied with a surface level understanding of any topic or field I turn my attention to. I see modern computing and technology as the obvious driver of the biggest and fastest changes in human history, they are things that almost everyone on the planet uses and absolutely everyone is affected by. So I felt I could no longer watch the progress from the sidelines, this is why I decided to change career, first taking self-led courses and now studying a 16 week intensive course in programming at Makers Academy.

## Skills

#### Attention to detail

This is a skill that I developed during my details focused Genetics degree at university, learning to use R software I was able to pick out a single upregulated gene from a dataset of over 70,000 data points of gene expression data and diagnose cancer (from cells from a mouse's colon). I also correctl noticed during my 6 months of lab work for my final year project that a particular line of investigation was unlikely to yield any useful data and was able to plan ahead of time a new procedure, saving at least a month of wasted lab time.

I have further honed this skill in my my professional positions. Working in finance, I have analysed client and creditor financial activity, crosschecked with credit information to identify fraudulent transactions and creditors operating under insolvency.

In my most recent role I was chosen to act as the operator for a sub-division of the crown real estate trust because of my recognised ability to notice small and potentially overlookable discrepancies in banking accounts regularly making £10m payments per quarter.

#### Communication and Leadership

In sixth form I delivered a school assembly detailing my work-experience on a clinical trial researching novel treatments for cystic fibrosis. I was commended for delivering it in a way that less science focused and particularly younger students were able to understand and engage with. Following this I decided to put my self forward for positions in which I could practice this skill further.

<span style="font-weight:normal">At University I worked in three extracurricular positions which allowed me to further develop my soft skills:</span>

- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

I was awarded a First class mark for my 8000 word write up of this project.
- Bioinformatics module - examining and manipulating large genetic expression datasets (>70,000 data points) using R and excel software.
- After extracurricular studying, I wrote a paper on the genetic approaches to xenotransplantation (First Class achieved).
