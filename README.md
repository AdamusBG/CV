## Adam Grieve

I am a first class Genetics graduate with two years’ post University experience in Finance and Analysis (fintech start-up and global investment administration business) looking to develop a career in the fast-paced and dynamic world of technology. 

I have always had a deeply held appreciation for all things with hidden layers of complexity and am not satisfied with a surface level understanding of any topic or field I turn my attention to. I see modern computing and technology as the obvious driver of the biggest and fastest changes in human history, they are things that almost everyone on the planet uses and absolutely everyone is affected by. So I felt I could no longer watch the progress from the sidelines, this is why I decided to change career, first taking self-led courses and now studying a 16 week intensive course in programming at Makers Academy.

I was awarded a First class mark for my 8000 word write up of this project.
- Bioinformatics module - examining and manipulating large genetic expression datasets (>70,000 data points) using R and excel software.
