## Adam Grieve

I am a first class Genetics graduate with two years’ post-University business experience looking to develop a career in the fast-paced and dynamic world of technology. 

I have always had a deeply held appreciation for all things with hidden layers of complexity and am not satisfied with a surface level understanding of any topic or field I turn my attention to. I see modern computing and technology as the obvious driver of the biggest and fastest changes in human history, they are things that almost everyone on the planet uses and absolutely everyone is affected by. So I felt I could no longer watch the progress from the sidelines, this is why I decided to change career, first undertaking several months of self-led, independent learning (focusing on Java & Python) and then completing a 16 week intensive course in programming at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/about-us/).

## Skills

#### Attention to detail

This is a skill that I developed during my details focused Genetics degree at university, learning to use R software I was able to pick out a single upregulated gene from a dataset of over 70,000 data points of gene expression data and diagnose cancer (from cells from a mouse's colon). I also correctl noticed during my 6 months of lab work for my final year project that a particular line of investigation was unlikely to yield any useful data and was able to plan ahead of time a new procedure, saving at least a month of wasted lab time.

I have further honed this skill in my my professional positions. Working in finance, I have analysed client and creditor financial activity, crosschecked with credit information to identify fraudulent transactions and creditors operating under insolvency.

In my most recent role I was chosen to act as the operator for a sub-division of the crown real estate trust because of my recognised ability to notice small and potentially overlookable discrepancies in banking accounts regularly making £10m payments per quarter.

#### Communication and Leadership

In sixth form I delivered a school assembly detailing my work-experience on a clinical trial researching novel treatments for cystic fibrosis. I was commended for delivering it in a way that less science focused and particularly younger students were able to understand and engage with. Following this I decided to put my self forward for positions in which I could practice this skill further.

<span style="font-weight:normal">At University I worked in two extracurricular positions which allowed me to further develop my soft skills:</span>
- I campaigned and was elected to the position of vice-president of my halls of residence's student committee. Being the second largest at the university it was my role to oversee our budget of £60k and to act as a point of soft contact for students with concerns. This position was made more difficult as, after only a month eight people out of the committee of ten had quit their positions, working with the president I ultimately took on responsibilities which were above and beyond what was expected.
- Through a selection process I was placed into a team of 6 people responsible for organising charitable events (including food bank drives and "puppies for the blind" whereby a local guide dog charity brought in puppies and allowed students to interact with them in return for donations) as well as managing teams of up to 50 younger students bucket collecting for charities at events like the Rugby sevens at Twickenham.

This is a skill that I continuted to bring into my professional life, managing client relations at a level above my formal position and successfully dealing with tough negotiations and civil cases.

First class degree in BSc (Hons) Genetics

Notable work:
- For my final year project, titled "An investigation into phenotypic trait variation in Fission yeast, *Schizosaccharomyces pombe*", I carried out 6 months of lab work aimed at designing robust methodologies to assess the magnitude of difference of phenotypic trait variation in the little studied Fission yeast. I was awarded a First class mark for my 8000 word write up of this project.
- Bioinformatics module - examining and manipulating large genetic expression datasets (>70,000 data points) using R and Excel software.
- After extracurricular studying, I wrote a paper on the genetic approaches to xenotransplantation (First Class achieved).

## Other information about me

I have a keen interest in science, history and world affairs keeping up by reading papers online and visiting museums.

I am also very interested in charity and enironmental justice, at university I part of a team which raised £80k for charities across the country, going towards a total for the university of £1.6m in 2016 and regularly attending peaceful protests and demonstrations.
